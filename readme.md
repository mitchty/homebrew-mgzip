homebrew-mgzip
==============

Homebrew tap for mgzip. It still compiles and works fine on osx. Also note using the git souce snapshot from [https://github.com/jerodsanto/mgzip](https://github.com/jerodsanto/mgzip) for the install.

Therefore this is a HEAD only formula.

# Installation

``brew tap --HEAD mitchty/mgzip``

``brew install mgzip``
